# Challenge Summary
## Linked List
Linked Lists are a data structure that offer certain advantages over array lists

## Challenge Description
The challenge was to create methods. Insert, Includes, forEach, toString, InsertArray

## Approach & Efficiency
For time, Insert has a Big O(1). All the other methods have a Big O(n). For space, all methods have a Big O(n).

## Solution
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

## Unit Tests
<!-- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

For each method that you define, write test assertions for the following conditions at minimum:

“Happy Path” - Expected outcome
Expected failure
Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)
Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code. -->
