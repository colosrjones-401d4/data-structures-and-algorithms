# Challenge Summary  
First in First out 'animal shelter' class  

## Challenge Description  
Create an AnimalShelter class that uses the first in, first out paradigm and accepts only cats and dogs. It has two methods: enqueue(animal) and dequeue(preference). You can add either a cat or a dog with enqueue(), and you can removve/retrieve a cat, a dog, or either using dequeue().  
  
## Approach & Efficiency  
The internal structure uses two Queues and both enqueue() and dequeue() have an O(1).
