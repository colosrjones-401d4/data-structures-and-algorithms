[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/colosrjones-401d4/data-structures-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/colosrjones-401d4/data-structures-and-algorithms)


## Challenge Summary
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge Description
Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

## Approach & Efficiency
BigO(n + k)
