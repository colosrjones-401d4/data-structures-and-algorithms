## Challenge Summary

# Reverse an Array
The idea is to reverse an array in place.

## Challenge Description
arrayReverse: creates a function that takes in an array and returns the same array with the values in reverse order. No array methods are used, the array is sorted in place, and empty arrays and non-array objects return -1.

## Approach & Efficiency
As array methods were disallowed as were array methods, I chose to use a for loop and a temp variable to iterate through the array and to swap the necessary variables. Big O = O(N);
