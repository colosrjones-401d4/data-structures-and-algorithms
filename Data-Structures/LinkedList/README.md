# Linked List kth-from-end

## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges. ​

kthFromEnd(value)

Input                  Args  Output

head->[1]->[2]->[3] ->  X      [2] 

## Solution

## Unit Tests
<!-- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

For each method that you define, write test assertions for the following conditions at minimum:

“Happy Path” - Expected outcome
Expected failure
Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)
Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code. -->
