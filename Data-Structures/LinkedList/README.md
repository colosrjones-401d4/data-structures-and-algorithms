# Linked List Insertions
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Challenge
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list

.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node

.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

## Solution

## Unit Tests
<!-- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

For each method that you define, write test assertions for the following conditions at minimum:

“Happy Path” - Expected outcome
Expected failure
Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)
Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code. -->
