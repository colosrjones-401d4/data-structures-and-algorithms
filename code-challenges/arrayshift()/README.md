# Challenge Summary
## Array Shift

In this challenge we were given an array and a integer value. Next we needed to insert that value into the middle of that array.

## Challenge Description
Inserting a given value into the middle of a given array and then making the second half of the array shift over one.

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of running a for loop for the first half of the array and putting those values into the new array. Then I took the given value and inserted it into the new array. Finally I ran another for loop to insert the second half of the values into the new array.

## Solution

## Unit Tests
<!-- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

For each method that you define, write test assertions for the following conditions at minimum:

“Happy Path” - Expected outcome
Expected failure
Edge Case (if applicable/obvious)
Unit tests must be passing before you submit your final solution code. -->
